# Privacy Policy

Some features — including the excellent Crowd Bypass to bypass even the unbypassable — needs to send requests to our servers to work.

These requests are stored in correlation with your IP address for up to 6 months in Germany and shared with Cloudflare [US] and could reveal part of your browsing history. For example, when Universal Bypass sends a request asking "Where does adf.ly/1234 lead to?" we know that the user behind that IP has just visited adf.ly/1234; however, we only use this information to improve Universal Bypass — not to find out anything about you.

If you do not trust us with this, which is understandable, you can visit Universal Bypass' options and disable all checkboxes which mention "Privacy Policy."
