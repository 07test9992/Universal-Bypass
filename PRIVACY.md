# Privacy Policy

Some bypasses will need to send a request to our servers to work.

If a request is sent, it will be stored in correlation with your IP address for up to 6 months in Germany. This information is also shared with Cloudflare [US].

Some features which need requests to work can be disable in the extension options.
